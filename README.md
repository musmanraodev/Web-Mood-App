Web-Mood-App
An express web which allows you to analyze the the mood of a website, with CRUD Feature.

Why not? Wouldn't it be cool if you could anaylyze the mood of any website and figure out How much happiness there is and How much sadness there is, and other stuff about it. Last Weekend, We built a slack bot which anaylyzes the the mood in the channel. So why not make an app which would let you know the mood of any website!
